For our mini project we would be taking city of Muenster as the proposed area for providing the information regarding the food stores. As Muenster being the student city and every semester lots of new students join the University and as being new in the city students find it really difficult to locate the food stores near to their residence or in city. Our information service/web page/ mini project would be addressing these issues by providing a user friendly solution via means of web. We would be locating prominent of the food stores in the city of Muenster which would include supermarkets (like REWE, LIDL, and ALDI etc.), restaurants, doner kebab shops and bakeries. The food stores will be categorized in some way, so that the user will be able to filter for the stores he is looking for. Categories e.g. might be supermarkets, fast-food, restaurants, cafés and bakeries.

With the help of our information service users might be able to locate the nearest food stores.
