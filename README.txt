For our mini project we would be taking city of Muenster as the proposed area for providing the information regarding the food stores. As Muenster being the student city and every semester lots of new students join the University and as being new in the city students find it really difficult to locate the food stores near to their residence or in city. Our information service/web page/ mini project would be addressing these issues by providing a user friendly solution via means of web. We would be locating prominent of the food stores in the city of Muenster which would include supermarkets (like REWE, LIDL, and ALDI etc.), restaurants, doner kebab shops and bakeries. The food stores will be categorized in some way, so that the user will be able to filter for the stores he is looking for. Categories e.g. might be supermarkets, fast-food, restaurants, cafés and bakeries.

With the help of our information service users might be able to locate the nearest food stores. 

Food stores would be displayed on map on our web page. By clicking on these locations we can get more information via a pop up box. Apart from showing the location on the map it would also show the operation time of the food store. This would be a very important feature as lots of people find it difficult to find the opened food store during late hours of night. We would be working on collecting the information on these locations which are opened late in the night or are operational whole night. 
Apart from that we would also be providing ‘add a food store’ feature in which users can also add new food stores in the city. That would help us make the date set richer and would provide more information to the other users about the new food stores in the city. The rough implementation idea of this feature would be a simple HTML Document, with a proper form to add the required data. This document should either be accessible on computers, as well as on tablets and smart phones. If a user passes by a food store that is not yet registered in our database, he can simply add it using our ‘add a food store’ feature, which will automatically register the user’s location.
